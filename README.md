## Hi there 👋

I'm a Front End Developer based in Milan, Italy passionate about motion and interactions. After working a lot with vanilla js, I approached the React ecosystem and then Next.js immediately appreciating it for its potential. In my free time I enjoy creating small libraries and experimenting with new technologies. Lately I've been enjoying exploring the world of WebGL and Three.js
